    <h1>The DrChrono Kiosk!</h1>
    <p>A doctor can login to setup the kiosk, such that patients can then use it to accomplish tasks.  Yep!

    <p>You can use this application; you should authenticate yourself, and you can do this by being redirected to DrChrono's web site, logging in, and you'll be redirected back here.
